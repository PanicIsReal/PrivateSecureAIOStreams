Simply clone, fill in the .env tokens etc pretty much everything is required.

Create a cloudflare tunnel and register the dns for it (all part of the steps of creating the tunnel)

Go to the AIOStreams:5000/ and configure it, point the proxy to your Cloudflare Tunnel.


Pretty much everything should be fairly straight forward and just work.
